## 📋 Project Description
This is a responsive multi-page website for a digital agency. It's designed to work well on all devices, including mobile, tablet, and desktop. The site includes smooth navigation between pages. The header and footer are separated into reusable components to keep the structure clean and consistent across pages. The contact form includes basic validation to ensure the user enters correct information. Data for projects is loaded from the server and displayed dynamically on the Project page.
